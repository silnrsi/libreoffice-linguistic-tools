Do not use a new StyleNameHandler object in StyleTypeHandler.update_change().
Instead, probably make a class that comprises StyleNameHandler and
StyleTypeHandler, something like ConverterControls.  "StyleControls" perhaps.

Then see if choosing a style radio will correctly set the style name from that
list box.

Fix 07-Mar-16 bug below.
Test ungrouped FontItemList.
Write grouping code.


## bug 07-Mar-16

Selecting a converter changed "Paragraph Style" to  "Custom Style".


## Sometime

Create put dialog definition files in /basic.


## reorganizing idea 28-Apr-16

MessageBox and UserVars go along with the document, like UnoObjs.
It would be helpful to create another class called MainDocObjs that inherits
from both.
UnoObjs would still not be abstract,
because not all documents are main documents,
for example the one opened by ExUpdater.
Many methods would require only UnoObjs,
but passing MainDocObjs to such a method is perfectly acceptable.

ProgressBar is somewhat temporary but could perhaps be a member as well,
just not initialized by default.

Would Calc documents be MainDocObjs?
Yes, if the dialog is called from Calc.
There would just be no user vars.
Perhaps that should be a class of its own.

The advantages of all of this are that it would simplify arguments and
class properties, and would more precisely express what is going on,
because it would be clearer what each class needs or uses.
However the disadvantage is that there would be lots of lines like:
    self.app.mainDoc.userVars.store(...)
Instead of:
    self.userVars.store(...)
And it would not be surprising to find that PyUNO couldn't check it.

Is there some other way to store mainDoc,
for example as a module level variable?
Perhaps:
    util.mainDoc.userVars.store(...)
Methods that use multiple documents would use variables that are more
local than util.mainDoc.


## Next OOLT version

Version 3.0:
    New Often-Requested feature (Bulk Data Conversion).
        Really a big change because it uses somewhat of a different
        design, with more processing done outside of Office.
    Grammar Settings improved for Flex - line 1, line 2.
    Make file size much larger by adding screen captures to documentation.
        Actually, make two downloads: one with lots of images, and one with
        almost none.  (That's what LibreOffice 5.0 does).
        With just a link to the help document online,
        and without LinguisticTools/tests.
    Spanish and French translations with help from David and Phil.
    Complete set of topdown tests.


## Possible Problem 2016-02-15

In the ODT document, a font may have an overridden font-name as well as
overridden font-name-complex.
Then it would show up as two different entries in bulk conversion.
So would the same text potentially get converted twice?
And it could show that for example Mangal is used,
when in fact it is only Times New Roman that is used,
although it was overridden to Mangal, so that's something.

-- A. Possible solution --

If text is marked with a particular font,
and that font is set to be converted,
then convert the text.
(Maybe it's not what the user wants, but that is up to the user to decide.)
If a particular section of text is marked to be converted twice,
then check for duplicates and just convert once.
If they are different then which one to choose?
Maybe complex preferred over standard.
(This is something the user can get around by just converting one at a time.)
All used fonts in the document should be listed, even if a font doesn't end up
contributing any of its glyphs because a fallback or other type font gets
used.

What about document default fonts?
One possibility is to have a "default" category.
That would make it clear that for example Times New Roman is never explicitly
used even though it is the default.
Although in that case, there could still be a lot of Times New Roman text.
But then that would be apparent in the number of samples.

-- B. Another Possible Solution --

Have one entry in the list be for "Times New Roman / Mangal",
and a different entry for "Times New Roman / Latha".
Defaults could be listed, so an entry might say "Default / Latha",
and another "Times New Roman / Default".

This seems like an accurate solution, but is it necessary?

-- C. Lookup --

It would be nice to avoid guessing by looking up character codes,
although that's not out of the question.
But one difficulty with guessing is that there might be an unknown font,
so we don't know whether to check complex or standard fonts.
Or can LibreOffice tell us that?
Wait a minute, we already know that from the XML file.
So we would just need to look up all characters in the samples and
determine if the characters are standard, complex or asian.
Although fonts such as Annapurna would be considered complex, wouldn't they?

It would be nice to have an option, disabled by default,
to convert characters by lookup.
Lookup would be based on ranges, not lists of characters.
Use the Unicode database file that tells the ranges.
0-256 = Latin
Ignore c.isspace() or c.isdigit() or c in string.punctuation --
assume it is whatever type the surrounding text is.
Base the assumption on the preceding character,
in order to make the code easier -- no lookahead required.


-- D. Are fonts such as Annapurna considered complex? --

No, they are considered Western.
It is all about the character set, which can be determined by finding
the Unicode block.

Unicode IPA (Doulos SIL) is also considered western.
CTL: Devanagari (Mangal), Tamil (Latha), Malayalam (Kartika)


-- E. A recommended solution. --

Looking at the above, here is a way to do all of this.
First, do we want to split up and merge sections based on lookup?
I think the answer is no, because if we do, then things get really
complicated, requiring lots of options, more difficult code,
and likely causing problems in the resulting document.

But lookup is useful, because it tells us whether the
string contains complex or CJK characters.
If it does, then we can consider the entire string as pertaining to that
font, and it can be listed that way in the font list,
without needing to display the other two fonts.
Now this is only information, because even if the lookup produces incorrect
results, the converter can still be performed in the same way,
if the user chooses the right font.

Maybe we should still show all three fonts in a different field.
I think if I use this, I would want to know what all three are.
If so, it could show more than one item in the list with the same name.
That could happen for different sizes as well.
Maybe two checkboxes:
[] Separate each font size.
[] Separate if other font types are different. 
The second checkbox could be considered an advanced feature.

With those two options, it seems like just about anything is possible that
someone would want to do.
If there is some complex and some standard text in a run,
then a TECkit converter could just convert the complex text,
so it hopefully won't be a problem.

-- F. Another thought --

Actually it might be good to move the checkboxes to step 1,
because we need it to read in the data correctly.
[x] Handle each style separately.
[] Handle each size separately.
[] Handle fonts of other types separately.  For example, handle
Devanagari complex data with Arial/Mangal/SimSun separately from Verdana/Mangal/SimSun.

-- G. Contradicting F --

No, let's keep a separating (or joining) checkbox in step 2.
The app layer will always store all font items as if fully separated,
and FontItem.attrs() will always return the full list of attributes.
Have a FontItemList object that somehow joins font items.
The items can be split or joined as needed.
If joined, a change to the settings affects each item in the group.
Joining and splitting does not immediately change any settings,
which makes it easier to see what the checkboxes do,
and may be useful for merging and then joining multiple times,
for example setting the size for everything, then splitting,
then changing some, then joining by style for a different type of change.
A box showing more than one setting should say something like "(Various)"
or "(Mixed)",
and maybe be italics, or something brighter like a yellow background.

One disadvantage with this approach is that samples will not necessarily
be shown in the order they occur in the document.
A serial number could be stored with each sample text to keep them in
the same order.
If there is more than one document, is this important?
Well, it doesn't seem like it would be that hard to do.
Actually we would just need to store one integer per font item,
which would tell the serial number at the beginning of the sample.
That would allow us to preserve the original order.

First implement everything separated, and then get various joins working.
But design the code in preparation for joining.
If the checkbox is named "Join" then it would better reflect what this
code would be doing.
 

## Rename line checkboxes in Grammar Settings

Morpheme Line 1
Morpheme Line 2

Line 1 will be checked by default.
This will break compatibility with settings,
requiring the user to change checkboxes.
The most common use is to just use one line,
so we want that transition to be smooth.
So have new user var names,
and ignore the old ones.
So it will default to Line 1 checked.

Make sure it doesn't matter to LingTools if for example the Tamil script is
in Line 2.

Toolbox orthographic tags will be line 1?
But then the default of using line 1 will use only orthographic
representation, which doesn't seem right.
Would it work to say if line 1 and 2 are both checked,
then we want orthographic text also,
otherwise just normal text?
No, because then it wouldn't be possible to show only orthographic text.
Let's make line 2 be orthographic,
even though that won't be how it ends up being shown (unless a hidden option
is set?).

Change the grammar documentation to describe FieldWorks first.


## Bulk Data Conversion

3. When "Process Files" is pressed, show progress bar.
   If confirmation is checked, then show Data Conversion confirmation dialog.
   When converted, show message box "Done!".

Choose what output format, or only output ODT?
To start with, only output ODT.

Use current (possibly blank) writer doc for possible destination fonts.
This is what Data Conversion does -- it allows a new style name,
and input fonts can be custom entered,
but output fonts are chosen from a fixed list.
In this case though, input fonts will be fixed.
It might be hard to create output styles, but that would be ideal.
Probably don't worry about that for the first attempt.

Second screen shows the results of the scan:
a list of all fonts and styles found in the files,
and the target font or style after it is specified.
- Font found
    "Annapurna"
- Character or Paragraph style if not custom formatting
    "MyCharStyle"
- Target font and style 
    "Mangal MyCharStyle"
That's still a lot of information per row, even though it is all Latin.
What about just font(style) or font(custom), and + if changes of some kind.
+ simply shows whether No Converter and Do Not Change are specified,
and hopefully this will be clear without needing a label.
(Show in documentation as well).
Can down arrow through list to see each item.

If a font is used without a style, then it should be shown as a font (Custom
Formatting).
This is consistent with how Data Conversion works.
If a font is used only with a style, then show as a style, telling what the
font of the style is.
If a font is used with and without a style, then show as two entries.
Could be more than two entries if a font is used with several styles.
    That could get annoying actually, if we just want to convert everything
    which uses that font.
    Checkbox to handle style and custom formatting together,
    which will change the list entries to just font instead of font(style).
    This will also grey out the target style fields.

If a size is not specified, then keep the original size,
which would allow multiple sizes to not get changed.

Maybe this will help in Bulk Conversion for .doc files:
libreoffice --convert-to

## Help text

The dialog shows &328.DlgGrammarSettings.HelpText on mouseover.
At least we should add an empty string or a space or something to make this
less ugly.


## Data Conversion test crashes on Linux 

On Ubuntu VM even test 1 crashes.
The debug.txt log seems to indicate that AddConverter() crashes.
That would make sense, since it has not been tested as much as normal Data
Conversion methods such as InitConverter().
Maybe AddConverter() just has a bug in the linux ECDriver code,
such as something simple like a string error when printing a message.


## Data Conversion string type problem

On Linux, SEC_wrapper is returning bytes rather than unicode string.
This is a problem in Python 3.
Perhaps the reverse is true for Windows and Python 2?
Anyway either make bytes work, or convert to unicode strings.
LibreOffice seems to accept either one, but it would be good to test this.


## Script Practice crashing

Can't change to Devanagari without crashing.  "20-Nov-15 LO 5.0.3"
Can't change to Khmer without crashing.  "20-Nov-2015 LO 5.0.3, AOO 4.1.1"
Can't change to Bengali without crashing.  "20-Nov-2015 AOO 4.1.1"
Can't change to Tamil or Devanagari without crashing.

Can change to Arabic, Bengali, Greek, Hebrew, Thai.
Seems to affect most South Asian scripts but not any others.

Also it occurred on Ubuntu and Windows LO (20-Nov-2015) but not after
LO had been open awhile,
and the Run Macro command opened its menu faster.

It occurs in the released version of OOLT.
Maybe it is a problem with my Win10 setup.


## Dialog controls font

Changed column to Gautami font for Telegu. However in Step
through List, still shows up as boxes.


## Extra text portions

Editing a ref number manually adds a new text section,
and then updating examples will only get part of the ref number.

Add a cleanup dialog? Like SOLID.
- first have an option that just looks for problems
- to fix, could simply replace the word string, which seems fairly easy.
- searching will be the difficult thing.
    + Replace the whole contiguous string, not just one word at a time.
      Or maybe a paragraph at a time. See how it is typically done in the XML.
    + Make a textcursor for the main text.
    + Loop through each frame and make a textcursor for each one.
    + Loop through each table and make a textcursor for each cell.


## User Var settings for Calc

Keeping Calc settings in Writer is annoying because I
save the Calc file but then the settings do not get saved. It is often
confusing in various situations.


## Faster updates?

Freezing screen is done with method lockControllers() of the document's Model.


## Spelling split up words

Suggest splitting up a whole word into two words with spaces.
For example if the good word list contains "big" and "dog" and it finds a
word "bigdog", then suggest "big dog" as a replacement.
Likewise if it finds "big-dog" or "big,dog".


## Spellchecking by good list

Adding a word is slow for large (20,000 rows) good lists.
 

## Gloss writing system

Writing system is only for phonetic / phonemic, not gloss.
For example Moreira:22 gloss has both "en" and "pt" writing systems.
Note that gloss does not use the "form" tag.


## Word list number of occurrences

Words will be counted twice if they match more than one
search criteria, for example Arial Bold font and Strong Emphasis style.


## XSLT partial matches

Match whole words like a full CC table does, or better.


## Normalizing

Collate number of occurrences according to a normalization form, perhaps NFD.
Also spell check this way.
Is there a library or something we can use to convert to NFD?
EncConverters will do it but that is awkward.
Unless we just require the user to convert everything to NFD.


## Update optimizing problem

inner table problem.odt
Change col width to 7%
Insert a second example
Update all
Result: Second example is optimized badly.
        Also the scrollbar does not work (unmaximizing fixes this).
Could not reproduce this problem starting with a new document.
This problem does not occur with Windows OpenOffice.


## Font display size problem

In Step Through List, some words are really small in Tamil.
However some are just fine. It depends on the word.
For example AA is small but A is fine.
The words appear this way in the formula, so this is not a simple problem.
Setting font size 14 at least makes the smaller size not so small,
even though the size still keeps changing.


## CTL font wrapping problem

WrittenTamilTexts.xml.Hunt02 tables does not wrap well when orthographic
lines are included (change fields to \or and \mbor).
Seems to be a Tamil script problem with mborth=kaliyana,
which goes across two lines.
Changing font from Latha to Lohit Tamil fixes the problem.
Probably there will not be a problem with Latha on Windows.
The best solution may be to use a font that works right for your system.


## Updating does not find first example if at very top of document (no space).


## Updating on failing to copy old ex num pastes whatever might be in clipboard.

Should check to see if what was copied is 0-length, or maybe if it failed or
something.


## Inserting examples is very slow

Seems to be just in LibreOffice.


## Grab Examples changing radio buttons crashed.

Seems to only happen sometimes.
Version: LO 5.0.3
Maybe happening because control labels are changing,
and it is having a hard time rendering the changes.


## Disposing

Do not crash if blank document gets closed.


## Ignore button presses

Disable dialog so that the user does not keep clicking on buttons
while a macro is executing.
- I accidentally did once.


## Don't show uno.exe crash

Is this possible to avoid?
It would be nice to show an error message about rebooting.


## Testing a deployed file

Often we want to verify the input and output parameters.
Can we have a driver or a receiver that checks each parameter?
This would not necessarily verify correct functionality,
just the parameters passed.
Question: When the extension is installed, where does the python code go?
          How to call it?
          The menu calls it by its service name.
          Can a button call it that way too?


## Possible OOLT 4.0 version

Connect directly to FieldWorks,
which means no need to save as XML,
which would be nice since it needs to be constantly updated otherwise.

Perhaps read from FW database using LO Base.
Could supply a LO Base template for this purpose.
Then in Writer Linguistics menu,
in phonology and grammar dialogs add a control to specify database source.

Would also be nice to have a way to automatically add reference numbers.
Perhaps the connection could be used to modify the FW databse.
Or ref numbers could be added in LO in a place that does not affect the
FW database.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version compatibility
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OOo 3.0.0 on Win uses Python version 2.3.4
For OOoLT 2.0, aim for compatibility for Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.0+.
- This allows 'as' exceptions, whereas 2.5 does not.
- give up on 2.5 for now, and see what AOO/LO versions that covers.

set(fontList) does not work.  Instead use Utils.uniqueList().
RuntimeError, IOError as exc -- change to (RuntimeError, IOError), exc
In older versions of python it is illegal to add () after a class declaration.
The @staticmethod decorator is new in version 2.4, so it does not work.
sort(key = ) does not work. Instead pass a function that compares values.
FilePicker must be initialized for OOo 3.0


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Importing

    loads UI.DlgSettings
        imports File.Utils

            imports Data.PhonEx

We could possibly use inheritance in the matter of grabbing examples.

# bugs
# - to get an idea of what could be tested for
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Used both dlg and self.dlg, so self.dlg ends up staying None.

Passed a dict intended to be shared between two objects, then in one of the
objects assigned it, which means they no longer share it.

Called a method that did not exist.  Perhaps pylint didn't catch it because
the object was passed as a parameter first?

ctrl.setText() may crash.

Passed (x, y) as params instead of x, y.

Passed y, x when it should have been x, y.

Passed the string but forgot to include its interpolating arguments.

Fixed bug in one place but not the same bug in another place.

Used len() but didn't implement __len__().  Pylint did not check this.

import uno failed because /program wasn't in sys.path.

import failed because package name case was incorrect on Windows.
    Pylint doesn't check for this.

Called a function with a named argument that did not have such a parameter.
Surprising that pylint didn't catch that.
Exception was a TypeError, and made AOO/LO fail silently.
The next error was an UNO exception,
and AOO displayed that one,
so perhaps it displays UNO exceptions but not python exceptions.

With repeated actions with multiple steps, should have handled the last action
differently.

Passed a list instead of a tuple to UNO.

Bug introduced by refactoring:
    prev code:
        a = x.y  # y is an immutable value
        b = x.y
        x.y = c
    new code:
        z = x.y
        a = z  # fine
        b = z  # fine
        z = c  # does nothing

Troubleshooting problems:
    Assimilated wrong office suite.
    Packed instead of assimilated.
    Forgot to assimilate or pack.
    Didn't save text file.
    Changed assimilated file and then assimilated, overwriting changes.
    Introduced a syntax error, so debugging statements don't show.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Using Visual Studio
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Editing code and tests can be done using the solution explorer.
Disadvantages:
- Minimum two clicks to switch between files, and perhaps expanding and
  scrolling.
    + This doesn't seem as good as buffers, although maybe it is
      better for larger projects where I am not as familiar with the code.
    + This is a substitute for the following Vim commands:
        - :b#
        - :ls
        - BufExplorer menu
- VsVim is limited in quite a few ways.
    + ga (does Alt+X work like it does in Wordpad?)
    + ^F (PageUp and PageDown are ok but less convenient)
- Text editor pane takes up about an inch more room than needed.
- Not on Linux.
- Support is not available for all languages.  For example support for
  Perl is probably not as good as for Python.
- IDE's may change more than text editors and command lines,
  so it might not be as good for people who are not fulltime software
  engineers.

Advantages:
- Automatic imports, check for undeclared vars.
- Navigate quickly to definitions.
- IntelliSense for builtins and libraries.
- Easier source control with git. (haven't tried)
- Industry standard.  For example Steve McConnel uses it.
- The professional version is probably better,
  so if the toolchain approach (Vim/Powershell/File Explorer) is roughly
  as good as an approach using VS Community Edition,
  then the pro version might tip the balance in favor of the IDE.
  That could be a reason to learn the IDE even with the community edition.

Are the coding assistance advantages really better than requiring an
understanding of how the code works?  Maybe.
For example I have grown accustomed to syntax highlighting.
Although part of the reason for that is it makes code easier to read,
not just detecting problems.
But coding assistance can also make it easier to read by showing where the
declaration and definition is for a particular item.
All things considered, it is probably a benefit.
It just might not always outweigh the cost.

Running from within Office will still be a separate window of course.

To run tests, perhaps VS has some way of running a bat file.
For assimilating code, ps1 files.
Also view debug files.

Finally delete debug files.
Will still need a powershell prompt open for this at least.

Then of course there's viewing this Design file.

NetBeans worked well for viewing a large Java project,
and the IDE was able to follow declarations and definitions.
A small Python project that I wrote is an entirely different matter:
- Python's loose structure is difficult for an IDE to follow reliably.
- For small projects, just opening up all file(s) at once is easier.
- When I know the code inside and out ("all in my head"), it's easier to
  navigate with a couple
  of keypresses than to have to browse to things with several clicks.
- The IDE may not be able to run the project from within LO.

    It disappears if you type something after the frame.
Find Next for updating gets stuck on the first one if it is not
    at the end of a line.
    It keeps searching from the beginning.
Updating grammar keeps saying "Found a ref number, but needs outer table."
    Once is enough; then just keep going.
Replacing grammar examples deletes the next character.
    Occurs using tables (not frames) with no outer table.
Vattalaki was set to ref number char style instead of JPDN.
    With all settings set to opposite of default.
Error message says "Column width is not a number" but then
dialog closes anyway, so there is not a good chance to fix it.

Version 1.9.9.5b
Hyphenated words are inserted as a single word in the word
list, yet spell check looks at each word separately.
When updating examples using tables, without outer tables,
the screen flashes strangely as it traverses through looking for the char style.
It makes it pretty slow.
    This happened because the whole document was the ref char style, because of
    the grammar inserting bug which is fixed now.
When inserting grammar examples without an outer table,
free translation in second example uses ref number char style.
When replacing grammar examples without an outer table,
it deletes the next character (for example #).

Do not allow setting a correction if the new is the same as the old.
In Step Through List, some words are really small in Tamil,
too small to see the difference between initial A and AA.
However some are just fine.  Does the font size change from row to row?
Perhaps the fields need to be taller because some glyphs require more room.

    How does this interact with the AutoSelect options?
    Perhaps the AutoSelect options are enough.
    Likewise with normalizing.

Show a waiting dialog
- Only needed the first time when the data is being loaded.
  "Reading XML file(s)..."
- A waiting dialog may make things more complicated for the user, because there is waiting for loading, and then waiting a shorter time to insert examples.  I suppose we could show a dialog box both times.
- Or perhaps we can just show a busy cursor.

Help files
- create PDF, then have option to show from a menu within OO,
  perhaps from the writeups menu.
    + reference the file in manifest.xml
    + html, PDF, odt
  perhaps display in a custom dialog box

First priority is phonology.
1. In FieldWorks: lex, gloss, refnum
2. Import into IPA.
3. Save as RTF.
4. Enter #(exnum)
5. Run macro that grabs all values.

It is not preferable to attach a separate python text file,
especially if it has to be put in a special user folder.
Also we don't want the user to have to use a configuration text file.
We can use a form instead to specify options.
Probably first try to emulate the function, with perhaps some improvements,
and then later check the code to see if we missed any functionality.

So the big question to answer first is,
what options are available for bundling macros into a document in a nice way?
- Forms
- embed the script within an OO doc
- packages (read-only)
- extensions - looks like an interesting possibility
    + like Zotero.oxt
    + just double-click on the extension, and then view the toolbar.
    + wouldn't even need a .odt file
    + Can we include sh2xml.exe inside an .oxt file?

Let's think of how Zotero functions.
1. Make changes in Firefox (Phonology Assistant for us).
2. Specify the options using a toolbar button in OO.
    - this sets or modifies styles
3. A button to insert a single example.
4. Another button to insert a whole set.


Grammar
    wrapping
    - table is fine
    - don't let the \tx line wrap
        + It seems like this won't happen by the optimize command unless there
          are way too many words on a single line.
    - other lines may be able to wrap
    - perhaps selectively use optimize and set width on specific columns,
      depending on how many characters are in the contents.
    - if longer than a certain amount, add another line
    - if more than one line is needed, then try to distribute the amount of
      text so that there is not more wrapping on the 1st line than the 2nd.
        algorithm:
        1. determine how many lines are needed
        2. distribute as evenly as possible while filling up all non-final rows.
           (It's ok for the final row to be full too).
           For example, say max 10 words per line, but 8 is better.
            A sentence has 17 words.
            17 div 10 = 2, so two rows will be needed.
            17 / 2 = 8.5, so 9 in first row and 8 in second row.
    select files
    - three browse buttons, for up to three different files
    - each file can be either FieldWorks or Toolbox XML files
    - the program can determine which kind it is by reading the file
    - If the XML is not of the right file type, then an error is shown
    - It would be nice to check this when closing the settings dialog,
      or even when finishing the Browse... button.
    FieldWorks reference numbers
    - The macro can calculate the "1.2" values without too much difficulty.
    - If there is more than one file, include the first few characters of the
      title in the reference number. Ex: #Pig1.2
    font size
    - Font size is important in order to choose the right number of characters
      on a line.
    - Specify font face and size in the dialog.
      Get current style attributes if any.  Then when OK is pressed on settings,
      update with new style attributes.
      If it's not to hard to have a color chooser, then might as well specify
      color in the dialog box too.
      Perhaps this is a feature that could be left until later.
    Interlinear fields
    - Text (TextIPA), Morpheme break (MorphemeBreak),
      Part of speech (PartOfSpeech), Gloss
    - for each, option to choose font and size,
      and checkbox to include it or not (Text is required)
    #- also may need to specify fields found in XML file
    - Guess which fields are in the XML file,
      for example Gloss should be ge or gl or g,
      in that order of likelihood.
    #Free translation, Reference (checkbox greyed out)
    Checkbox to insert an example number
    Checkbox whether wrapping non-Text fields is allowed
    #- Or perhaps we can say Character Width: "Small (works for 9-10 pt),
    #  Medium (works for 11-12 pt), Large (works for 14 pt),
    #  Extra Large (works for 18 pt, or 14 pt fixed with)
