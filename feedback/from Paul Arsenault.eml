Hi Jim,

Thanks for your message about PA and Open Office. I'm one of the  
phonology consultants who will be working with the teams in Nasik. I  
will leave the issue of Open Office for others, but I have a different  
question of my own. Based on your email I'm thinking you might be the  
appropriate person to ask. If not, please feel free to redirect me.

I'm a Mac user, but in preparation for the workshop I decided to load  
Windows 7 on my Mac using the Parallels software. If you are not  
familiar with it, Parallels is a software that allows you to run a  
virtual Windows machine on a Mac. I did this in the hope that I could  
run Windows programs such as Phonology Assistant, Fieldworks, and  
Toolbox on my Mac. This would allow me to work with the same programs  
and data that the teams are working with. For the last two days I've  
been installing software to get this virtual system up and running. So  
far so good. Windows 7 is running and so are Fieldworks and Toolbox.  
Phonology Assistant is giving me some trouble. It installed without  
any apparent problems, but it won't load. When I try to open it I get  
the following message:

Outer Exception:

The type initializer for 'SIL.SpeechTools.Utils.FontHelper' threw an  
exception.

\Phonology Assistant\src\SpeechToolsUtils

This is all Greek to me. Does it make any sense to you? If so, any  
ideas of what I need to do to fix the problem? If not, any idea who I  
should talk to about this?

Thanks!!

Paul

PS. I'll be flying to India tomorrow (from Canada), so I may be off  
email for a few days.
